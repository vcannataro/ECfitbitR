# ECfitbitR

You can use the `ECfitbitR` package to access your FitBit data through
the FitBit API and format your data for easy analysis. This package
relies heavily on the excellent
[`fitbitr`](https://github.com/teramonagi/fitbitr) package to do the
heavy lifting of interacting with the API. Please visit
[`fitbitr`](https://github.com/teramonagi/fitbitr) for more details of
the extensive functionality therein, as `ECfitbitR` is designed with
limited but specific functionality in mind.
